# Business Insights  

## Overview  
This repository showcases a financial analysis extracted to derive meaningful insights into a company's day-to-day activities. The project involves analyzing a relational database comprising **10 interconnected tables** using **Power Query**, **Data Modeling**, **DAX**, and **Power BI** for visualization.  

## üìö Database Design  
The database was designed to capture key aspects of business operations, facilitating a comprehensive analysis. Below is an overview of the datasets used:  

- **AccountHolder**: Information on individuals or entities holding accounts within the organization.
- **Account**: Details of financial accounts, including types and associated balances.  
- **Customers**: Demographic and segmentation data about the organization's customers.  
- **DepartmentGroup**: Hierarchical categorization of departments across the organization.  
- **FactTable**: A central table holding transactional and aggregated data for analysis.  
- **Finance**: Financial metrics such as income, expenditure, and profit details.  
- **Organization**: Structural details of the organization, including divisions and regions.  
- **Product Cost**: Information on the costs associated with products.  
- **Products**: Details of the organization's products, including categories and pricing.  
- **Returns**: Data related to product returns, including reasons and volumes.  

## üîó Data Modeling  
A **galaxy schema** (or fact constellation schema) was employed to support complex queries and analyses across multiple business processes.  

### Key Aspects of the Schema Design  
- **Three fact tables**: `FactTable`, `Finance`, and `Returns` are connected via a shared **Date table**, enabling cohesive time-based analysis.  
- **Shared dimension tables**: `Products` and `Customers` are used by multiple fact tables to provide a unified view of key attributes across datasets.  
- **Granularity**: Ensured accurate granularity for transactional data across all fact tables.  
- **Normalization**: Dimension tables were normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.  
- **Advanced DAX**: Calculated columns and measures were implemented to derive insights efficiently.  

## üõ† Tools and Technologies  
- **Power Query**: Used for cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data.  
- **Data Modeling**: Applied to define relationships and optimize the database structure using the galaxy schema approach.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Utilized for creating dynamic calculations and aggregations.  
- **Power BI**: Leveraged to build interactive dashboards and visualize insights effectively.  

## üìà Key Findings  
This project delivered valuable insights into various aspects of the business:  

1. Identified areas for improvement in inventory management, enabling process optimization. 
2. Uncovered top-performing products and seasonal sales patterns, informing strategic decision-making.
3. Delivered segmentation insights, enhancing targeted marketing efforts and customer engagement.  
4. Exposed cost-to-revenue ratios and pinpointed opportunities for expense reduction, driving financial efficiency.
5. Examined product return trends, yielding actionable recommendations for quality enhancements and customer satisfaction¬†improvement.

## üí°Recommendation
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1. Streamline inventory management to minimize stockouts and improve order fulfillment efficiency.
2. Address high-return products by investigating and resolving quality or usability concerns.
3. Focus on promoting top-performing products to maximize revenue and enhance profitability.
4. Develop a customer segmentation strategy to improve targeted marketing and boost customer retention.
5. Leverage return trend insights to implement preventive measures, such as better product descriptions or enhanced quality control, to reduce return rates.
